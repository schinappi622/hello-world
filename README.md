# hello-world
I am learning how to use GitHub!

I am just starting out with GitHub with the hopes of learning how to use it properly for my data-analyst future. I have just started to self teach myself Python, Sports Analytics, Sports Writing, and useful data-centered communities like GitHub and Kaggle. I am excited to see where this journey takes me!
